# Installing Minecraft Bedrock Server

How it was done to Assist in the installation of Minecraft Bedrock server for an installation of a simple line of the terminal.

please install **curl** to speed up the installer.

run <code> sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sirherobrine23/Minecraft-Bedrock-auto-install/master/install.sh | bash; cd installer </code>.

This Script only speeds up the server installation for MCPE (Minecraft Bedrock).

currently installation options:
    --install - installation for ubuntu X64
    --screen - Add screen, plus the server installation to work 24 hours without the need to leave ssh or another means connected
    --start-file - Add a file to "screen mcpe"
    --sistema - Add a script to start together with the system through the service
    --ip - Show your available IPs
    --unistall - remove the installer folder

#### Tested on ubuntu and debian I don't know if it will work on other distros that use apt.
